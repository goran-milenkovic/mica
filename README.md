# Mica
Strategy board game for two players.
The game proceeds in three phases:

1. Placing men on vacant points
2. Moving men to adjacent points
3. (optional phase) Moving men to any vacant point when the player has been reduced to three men

### Phase 1: Placing pieces
The game begins with an empty board. Red and blue players placing their men one per play on empty points. If a player is able to place three of their pieces on contiguous points in a straight line, vertically or horizontally, they have formed a _mica_ and may remove one of their opponent's pieces from the board and the game, with the caveat that a piece in an opponent's mica can only be removed if no other pieces are available. After all men have been placed, phase two begins.

### Phase 2: Moving pieces
Players continue to alternate moves, this time moving a man to an adjacent point. A player can "break" a mill by moving one of his pieces out of an existing mill, then moving it back to form the same mill a second time (or any number of times), each time removing one of his opponent's men.  When one player has been reduced to three men, phase three begins.

### Phase 3: "Flying"
When a player is reduced to three pieces, there is no longer a limitation on that player of moving to only adjacent points: The player's men may "fly" from any point to any another not taken point.
